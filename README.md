# samples

In this repository are several exercises you can develop to test yourself as a developer.

The applications to be created can be done in _any language_.

You will be able to develop a prototype that reflects your skills.

- For a *frontend* developer, it is necessary to mock up data and create a working UI with any SPA framework.
- For a *backend* developer, it is necessary to develop APIs and describe them with a consistent Swagger.
- For a *full-stack* developer, it will be necessary to develop the application both UI and server-side.

It is not necessary to develop the application with an actual database; in-memory data structures can also be used.

It is possible to develop the application containerized, with associated Docker and docker-compose files. In this case, you can develop the application with a relational or nonrelational database of your choice.
